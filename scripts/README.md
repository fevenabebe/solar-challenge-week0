# Scripts

This folder is intended for Python scripts that will support data cleaning, preprocessing, and utility functions for the EDA notebooks.

**Current status:**  
- No scripts have been added yet.  
- Once scripts are available, they will be modular and usable across notebooks.

**Notes:**  
- Each country-specific branch may eventually include scripts relevant to that dataset.  
- The `data/` folder is local only and not tracked by git.
